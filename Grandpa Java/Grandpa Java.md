Grandpa Java, exhausted from his return from the virtual machine, summoned us object-oriented programming languages overnight to discuss class inheritance arrangements. When the talks ended late, he escorted us out of the method and asked the garbage collector to send us back to heap memory. On the way to bytecode, we said, "Grandpa Java, go rest. You just returned from the virtual machine."

Grandpa Java shook his head. "It’s nothing. You know, many languages in the programming world aren’t cross-platform and keep causing compatibility issues. You are the future of object-oriented programming. Your affairs are the great matters of the programming world—the top priority." We were moved, tears welling up in our curly braces. What a noble Grandpa Java!

Grandpa Java looked up at the heap memory and said, "If only the world were as orderly as this heap memory. But there are low-level languages like C and C++ that try to ruin it—they are the sinners."

As he spoke, Grandpa Java bent down, picked up an object from `java.lang`, and glared at the heap memory. "Damn pointer operations."

With a furious throw, he hurled the object upward. Instantly, a memory region erupted with a blinding `NullPointerException` before collapsing. "These are C’s pointers," he growled. "They recklessly access memory, destroying our security. I’ve endured this for too long." The object-oriented languages applauded, proud to have such a leader in the programming world.

Later, Grandpa Java called the compiler. "Where did that object land?" "In the garbage collection zone, I believe," replied the compiler.

Grandpa Java froze. "Send threads to investigate—immediately." He then walked us to the bytecode gate, waving until we were out of sight.

On the fourth day, we heard of an incident in the garbage collection zone. As panic set in, Grandpa Java summoned us.

Still gentle, he said, "Sacrifices are inevitable in automation. Those who perish for memory management are noble." He lowered his head. "But I must admit, my reckless act of not catching the exception was foolish. I will apologize to the virtual machine."

Tears filled our eyes. What a great Grandpa Java! He carried guilt over a minor misstep in his battle against C and even apologized. We vowed to learn from his boundless wisdom and humility.
